# Ethereum-Smart-Contract-for-Secure-Message-File-Sharing-
Smart contracts are computer protocols that are easily verifiable to conduct trustworthy transactions between peers without middle-men or third parties. These are contractual agreements that are self-executing, providing high level of privacy and security at the same time. Blockchain protocols can be implemented through them. These smart contracts use the concept of cryptography and digital signatures that ensure immutability of transactions carried out. 

Here the Smart Contract has the following participants:
1. Division A- This department has to work only on the ground level
2. Division B- This department investigates with say power X
3. Division C- This department also investigates but with power Y
4. The Judge D- He is the one who handles the case

It is a must that the divisions A, B and C are completely independent of each other for the result of a case to be unbiased. But in real life there is no such guarantee. But through Smart Contracts on Blockchain, it is possible to ensure that these parties are independent by sharing data in a trustless and secure manner. It also provides transparency for the Judge and the public as they can see the work done by the organisation when the investigation is done.  

IPFS hash can be used to secure share files using the same Solidity Code.
